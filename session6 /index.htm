            Consequences of malnourishment:
            Human capital, physical capability, and cognitive skills are affected
            Once a child is malnourished or stunted, it’s a life sentence
            Every year, we lose trillions of dollars bc of different burdens of malnutrition
                human development issue, economic issue, and a health issue
            The United States life expectancy has declined
                drugs, etc., BUT an important factor is diet
            Many countries lose 10% GDP equivalent every year bc of malnutrition

                Threefold Challenge:
1. Match the rapidly changing demand for food from a large and more affluent population to its supply
    1. Do so in environmentally and socially. Sustainable ways
    2. Requires changes in the way food is produced, stored, processed, distributed, and accessed (Similar to the radical changes that occurred during the Industrial, Agricultural, and Green Revolutions
2. Increases in production will have an important part to play, but will be constrained as never before by Earth’s finite resources (land, oceans, and atmosphere)

Patterns in global food prices are indicators of trends in the availability of food (for those who can afford it and have access to the world markets
Many commentators have predicted spikes

                system: is an interconnected set of elements that is coherently organized in a way that achieves something
	must consist of three things: elements, interconnections, a function or purpose
	ex. Digestive system: teeth, enzymes, stomach, intestines
		interrelated though physical flow of food, and though a set of regulating chemical signals
		function of this system is to break down food into its basic nutrients, transfer into bloodstream (another system), while discarding unusable wastes
Systems can be imbedded in systems
Is anything not a system? Yes, a conglomeration without any particular interconnections or functions
	arbitrarily add or take away pieces of a system—ends up no longer being the same system
	when something dies, it loses its “system-ness”
		the multiple interrelations that held it together no longer function, although its material remains part of a larger food-web system
Systems can chage, adapt, respond to events, seek goals, mend injuries (although they may contain or consist of nonliving things)
	new, never before imagined systems can arrive out of one system
