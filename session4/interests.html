        My top 3 interests are as follows; <a href="#anchor1"> Food </a>, <a href="#anchor2">Cats</a>, and <a href="#anchor3">Traveling</a>!
    </p>

    <h2 id="anchor1"> Food</h2>

        My favorite food is <a href="https://www.amigosburritos.com">TACOS</a>, & I also really enjoy anything with <a href="https://toddenglishfigs.com">FIGS</a>! <br>
        There is also a restaurant in Boston named "Figs" that is also delicious! <br>
        <br>
        I'm not the best chef, but I have been trying to make different recipes lately. <br>
        <br>
        Attached is a photo of my favorite restaurant in the North End of Boston, Trattoria Al Panino.

        My cat <b>Yuki</b> is about 7 months old, so she is very hyper still.<br>
        She gets <i>zoomies</i> at night where she <b>runs</b> laps around my apartment...until 1:00am. <br>

      Sadly, I haven't really traveled much lately, but my favorite place that I have traveled to is <b>Tokyo, Japan.</b> <br>
      I hope to travel to South America on my next adventure, and I hope it's soon! <br>
    <br>
    Lastly, here is a photo of Tokyo, Japan!
